Week 7! Wow time flies really fast which is kinda sad, but I can't change that:( 
During this week(October 29- November 1)we focus on Contracts.


On Monday(October 29), we did Introduction to Function and Definitions. we were suppose to see how expressions are demonstrated. Also we were suppose to see the differences and similarties between two definitions. In differentr computer science languages, things are represented differently. For example in Schem. a function would be represented the following: (*3(+ 4 9). In Pyret they are presented like this (3(space) *(space) 4(space) + 9). They have the same structure and would get the same answer but they are presented differently. We also used fun(puret language) which defines new functions when needed. 
We were also required to use the design receipes contracts in order to write a given contract from a scenario. We did double, triple  and plus 1. They all had the same contract: double(or triple or plus1) :: (a-num:Number)-> nUmber and than the definition is fun double(a-numb): a-num *2 end 


On Tuesday(October 30)
