This week of October 9 to October 11, in Mr. Allatta's class we learned about the following:
Tuesday(October 9) is Make a collage about any flag of your choice. Find it geometry and make it on a construction diagram. The flag I did was Frane. 

Wednesday(October 10) is Contracts and APIs. We defined what are contracts. Contracts are an agreement between a computer and a program which tell us what to do. An APIs is an application programming interface. We also did exaples of contracts like 
```
#Contract
rectangle::(width:: Number, height:: Number, mode:: String, color:: String) -> Image 
#Example 
rectangle(11, 30, "outline", "blue")
```

Thursday(October 11)is updating our blogs and how they should really be. We were showed different types of reflections from our classmates. Some of them were not even talking about anything related to APCS, but related to some other stuff. We also went over what are the Blog rules which are 
1. Our Learing- Summarize learning and make connections 
2. My Learing- How I contribute, reflecr on personal contribution and struggle&challenges. 

See you soon!
