Well is already week 3 and time is passing wait too fast to not pay attention to the class. Durning the past week I have learned about the different types of HTML tags in the structure of Markup Data. I also learned what different HTML tags actually mean and how they are used. For example I learned that <nav></nav> stands for a set of navigation links. 
 
 We also learned about Exploring structure in Animation and how it started. Well it started from women(which surprised me) named Grace Hopper who was the first programming language and Ada Lovelace who was the first envisoned computers. 

Durning the past week we also learned about our Flag Design Project which we have to design a program to represent the flag of a country. We have to understand how flags are being used and how we have to program them by knowing the language of the problem you are trying to solve. 

I feel confident in this project because it looks easy and I hope I could do it. The only thing I feel I will have challenges is how to put three different colors in one. But all challenges could be solved by paying attention to the class.
