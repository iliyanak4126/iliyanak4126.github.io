Heyyyyyy another week pasted, and I learned new stuff that I didn't know before!This past week(October 22 to October 25), we did the followinng:

On Monday(October 22nd), we did Introduction to Data Science. We learned that a table has a header and a data rows. To make the table actually work and have codes inside you follow the following:
shapes = table: name, corners, is-round
  row: "triangle", 3, false
  row: "square",  4, false
  row: "circle", 0, true
  row: "rectangle", 4, false
  row: "ellipse", 0, false
    end
The shapes shows how the headings of the table would be. The rows would have different names because it shows the name of the code(ex: triangle or circle), than how many corners has the certain shape and than if the shape is round or not. 
A connection that I remember is that we used boolean at the beginning of the year and last year during computational algebra, in order to determine if something is right or not.

On Tuesday(October 23rd), we did Table Literals and Lookups. We used the same code that we used on Monday(the code below) and we had to explain on what would happen if a student that just came to our class have to do in order to be successful on evaluting expressings.
shapes = table: name, corners, is-round, sample
  row: "triangle", 3, false, (3,"solid", "red")
  row: "square",  4, false
  row: "circle", 0, true
  row: "rectangle", 4, false
  row: "ellipse", 0, false
    end
Some tips I said that would be helpful is to always space out there code, when using quotes or anything they should always have an closing. Always define your code. 

On Wednesday(October 24rd), we did Table Methods and Visualization. On this day we got the code for pie-chart and bar-chart which is:
pie-chart(shapes, "name", "corners")
bar-chart(shapes, "name", "corners")
That was helpful because it shows our results from the tables in graphs that would be useful for people that need evidence on something you are working on. 

Finally on Thursday(October 25th), we did Importing Data. We had to compare two tables that were on google sheets and one of pyret. Both of them were the same but they were demonstrated different. We have two different types of tables that produce a table value. One of them is Tavle literal that is made into the program and the other one is imported table which is getting tables from somewhere else. 

Connectings I could make is at the beginning of the year we were getting only the code for one thing. For example we had to make a rectangle which is rectangle(11, 30, "solid", "blue") and we would only make an example. Now we use the same codes to put them into tables and make visual representations that would actually produce the image with the code and how many sides it has and if is round or not.
See you, next week APCS!
