This week(Sep.24 to Sep.27) in Mr. Allatta we learned about what really changes in computer science, video game coordinates and a flip book animation. The big questions we should ask ourselfs in computer science are what's changing?, how does it change and etc. We had to play some game and take notes in order to see how does it actually change. In the Video Game coordinate it was kinda challenging and kinda easy because I was confused at first but that once I understood it, finding the points was easy. It remonds me of the game we did last year in computational algebra where we had to located our danger and our player at a certain point.
