Hey guys! Week 11 already!

This past week(December 3-6) we did the following:
Monday(December 3), we returned to our flag project, but we to pick a flag out of two choices, so I'm doing USA flag. The USA flag is kinda complicated because it has 13 stripes that are in a rectangle. Those 13 stripes are red and white and the first 7 stripes are like cut into 3/4 of the sizes of the rest stripes in the flag. Than you have a rectangle that is covering  those 3/4 stripes which contains white stars on a blue background. The flag is complicated because I don't know how I'm gonna display 50 stars all together. We also did a research on the flags we picked in order to know more about it and to understand how we should code it. I found measurements that are propotional in order to make the USA flag. Those numbers are too small so when coding I have to multiply them in order to get a bigger size. 

Tuesday(December 4), we did a like a little research and than we were suppose to demonstrate our flag by using contruction papers and use the right measurements, so when we code we would use it.

Wednesday(December 5)we continues to work on demonstratng our flag on contruction paper.

Thursday(December 6), I was on a field trip, so I'm not sure what they did on this day in class. 

Well this was my week in APCS, seen you next week guys!:)
