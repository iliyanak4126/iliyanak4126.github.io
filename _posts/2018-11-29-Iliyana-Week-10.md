Well Week 10 already... Time be flyging so fast and I don't like it :(

This past week(November 26-29) we didn't have the usual lessons because we had to take a baseline and a midterm.
On Monday we had a Baseline that had three different parts and it came from the APCS test. I think I did pretty okay for having this class now for almost 3 months with Mr.Allatta. 
On Tuesday we had the actually Midterm which was going okay but it was kinda hard. But I hope I did okay on it because I tried my best to study and do practice questions. 
Wednesday and Thursday, we are going over the midterm and the propabilities of the questions and answers the students did. 

 The question I picked was:(Verson 1=19, Version 2=21)
 ```
      6. Which function application matches the contract below?
                    #message-cost:: Number -> Numbe
   a) message-cost(16)
   b) message-cost("where are you")
   c) message-cost(25,15)
   d) prefer-flavor("lemon","lime")
   ```
 Correct asnwers(A)
 Explanation: MS1, APP, generate applications
 Answer permulations (All answers permuted)

I picked this question because it shows how a function is displayed and what it needs in order to make the certain image or a problem or to solve anything. This question displays how the contract is given and you need to match it with the right function. This is a level of appreince because it takes 1 or 2 steps in order to figure it out and you seen a question like that before in class or somewhere else. This is a MS1 because you are matching contracts and evalutating expressions in order to indetify what you will get.
