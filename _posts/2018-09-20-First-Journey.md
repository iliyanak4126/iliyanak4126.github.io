Hey guys! My name is Iliyana Kirilova, I'm 16 years old and I go to Academy for Software Engineering HS. 
I'm from Bulgaria :) and I love to travel. I moved from Bulgaria when I was 10 and I started school here in NYC when
I was in 5th grade. I love to dance, so I go to traditional Bulgarian dance classes during sunday while I attent 
school there also.
