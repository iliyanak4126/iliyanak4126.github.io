Hey guys! My name is Iliyana Kirilova, I'm 16 years old and I go to Academy for Software Engineering HS. 
I'm from Bulgaria :) and I love to travel. I moved from Bulgaria when I was 10 and I started school here in NYC when
I was in 5th grade. I love to dance, so I go to traditional Bulgarian dance classes during sunday while I attent 
school there also.
But back to the topic, I'm very intersted in computer science and I like coding and making new stuff.
For making this website, I had a little challenge for putting in the code. But I actually learned new stuff too.
I learned how to make floders and than add files. I also had a challenge of getting my website to work because
I didn't erase one of the codes that was suppose to be delete after the second was there.
But everything else was easy if you follow the steps and pay attention to what you are doing.
