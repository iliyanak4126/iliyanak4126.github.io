Wow, time passes really fast and I can't believe I been in school for like 5 weeks now.
This week(October 15-October 18) in this class we learned a couple of new things and we did activities that would help us understand the topic even better.
On Monday(October 15), we've learned how to do new contracts.For example we got the code for circle, ellipse and rectangle. Also we got the code for place-image and how it works.Place-image would take in two arguments and two numbers. This was a new thing for me because I only knew about overlay for putting two things together. This was amazing because when Mr. Allata showed us the example and how you name your variables however you want and than put them together amazed me. Like you put the two arguments into place-image and than you make a whole code which you add the third shape(if needed).
