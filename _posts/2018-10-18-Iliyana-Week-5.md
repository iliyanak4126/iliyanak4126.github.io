Wow, time passes really fast and I can't believe I been in school for like 5 weeks now.
But this week(October 15-October 18) in this class we learned a couple of new things and we did activities that would help us understand the topic even better.

On Monday(October 15), we've learned how to do new contracts.For example we got the code for circle, ellipse and rectangle. Also we got the code for place-image and how it works.Place-image would take in two arguments and two numbers. This was a new thing for me because I only knew about overlay for putting two things together. This was amazing because when Mr. Allata showed us the example and how you name your variables however you want and than put them together amazed me. Like you put the two arguments into place-image and than you make a whole code which you add the third shape(if needed). I put all three of my arguments like this: 
Flag=place-image(the third argument and where it should be) with the first and second argument. 

On Tuesday(october 16) we did pair programmning and my partner was Kedwin. Kedwin and I had to solve tasks that start out really easy and than get challenging at the end. We both worked together successfully because if I missed out something from the code or he did, we would tell each other and fix it together. We used our notes if we had diffuclty and we asked the people around us if  we needed help. Also during the pair programming we had two roles: the driver- someone that cntrols the keyboard and mouse and Navigator - someone who uses their notes and checks over the code for low level thinking( spelling, grammer and syntex), plus high level thinking(the whole problem together).

On Wednesday(October 17) we've talked about our flag project performance task and the requirments we need in order to pass the class APCS. Some requirments to pass APCS is to make 2 projects or performance task and 1 multipul choice exam. 
After that we had to finish our flags projects with minimum working examples which means we have no errors when clicking the button run on Pyret. 
As show above my flag was suppose to represent France, but I still need to finish putting the three colors in the right order and fixing the coordinates of them. 

The last day which was Thursday(October 18), we did adding images with markdown. Adding Images with Markdown means that we had to get our picture of our flag we made on pyret and save it on the computer where we name it "Flag.png" and than we go to Github. When we were in Github we were suppose to make a new folder with a file "images/README.md" which would make the new folder. After that we had to upload our flags on Github and here so it would show on the website. Some challenges I had were that I was confused on how I was suppose to upload the picture but than when I opened the images folder I saw a box saying 'upload files' and I upload it.

Well this was our week in APCS. See you next week!
